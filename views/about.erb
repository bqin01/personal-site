          I am a student born on April 9, 2001 in Toronto, ON, Canada interested in algorithm design, full stack app development, mathematics,

        <h2>
          After attending both grade school and middle school in Toronto, I was accepted to attend Phillips Academy in Andover, MA and matriculated
          in September, 2015. There, I became interested in the video arts, fencing, and American law, while being able to continue pursuing
          mathematics and computer science.
